Welcome to a place to collaborate on developing a force gauge for the nerf hobby



Here is the current BOM:
-- https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771  Adafruit Feather 32u4 - $19.95 - the load cell library needs more memory than a basic Arduino can provide
-- https://www.adafruit.com/product/4543 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C3QK2693 20Kg Strain Gauge Load Cell - $3.95 or https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082Q1P87H 100kg or https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH9Q9LK 50kg or 
-- https://www.adafruit.com/product/4538 Adafruit NAU7802 load cell interpreter - $5.95 - I've tried several different ic packages including the popular HX711 and this one is the easiest to set up and not cost an arm and a leg 
-- https://www.adafruit.com/product/4209 quiic cable - $0.95
-- a usb micro cable - free
-- metric hardware (20kg load cell - 2x M4 2x M5) Washers or metal bushings as a standoff (50kg/ 100 kg load cell - 4-6x M6)
-- A modified clamp - Needs to be solid to help resist the flex of the load cell https://www.homedepot.com/p/BESSEY-LM-4-in-Capacity-Light-Weight-Clamp-with-Die-Cast-Zinc-Jaws-and-2-in-Throat-Depth-LM2-004/303812563 for example
-- A target plate (This needs revision It needs minimal flex. The paint can lids I've been using are not good enough)

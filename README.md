Welcome to Project JEDI, the open source force gauge for the nerf hobby!





Current BOM:
-- https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771  Adafruit Feather 32u4 - (Any equivalent large memory Arduino compatable board would work as well. The load cell library needs more memory than a basic Arduino can provide)
-- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH9Q9LK 50kg  Strain Gauge Load Cell - (This code can be adapted to various load cells. The impact force is light enough that a 20kg cell is theoretically suffuficent, however we had better results with a 50kg or 100kg cell. Be aware, load cells are very delicated and need to be handled and transported with care). 
-- https://www.adafruit.com/product/4538 Adafruit NAU7802 load cell interpreter - (We've tried several different ic packages including the popular HX711 and this one is the easiest to set up and use)
-- 2x https://www.adafruit.com/product/4209 quiic cable  - (To connect between the screen and board and the load cell and board) 
-- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T6SJBV5 I2C 128x64 SSD1306 monochrome OLED screen 
-- a usb micro cable 
-- 4x M6 x ____mm screws 
-- 6x M3 x 12mm cap head screws 
-- 6x M3 x 6mm x 5mm heat set inserts 
-- 12x Washers or metal bushings - (To be used as a standoff between the target plate and the load cell 
-- https://www.homedepot.com/p/BESSEY-LM-4-in-Capacity-Light-Weight-Clamp-with-Die-Cast-Zinc-Jaws-and-2-in-Throat-Depth-LM2-004/303812563 - (Needs to be modified as shown in the pictures) 
-- https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-6-in-x-18-in-16-Gauge-Plain-Steel-Sheet-Metal-1701/332733441 A 6in x 6in square of 16 gauge steel to be used as the  target plate 



When assembling the screen can either be secured by a couple dabs of hot glue (removable) or melting the 4 pegs (permanent) 
There are places in the bottom part where a magnet could be embeded if desired. 3mm thick neodymium pancake magents work well here
